				- will they have a fit with a man "hanging" from a noose?
		- timer?
			- not a good idea when it comes to multiplayer
				- timer disabled on ranked mp but not local mp
		- make word packs possible
			- some word packs if approved by us, will be added to the official word pack server.
			- to prevent "private servers" of wordpacks, encrypt every link in the code with base64 and some of it in another cipher.
			- add word packs to included files, and have parser read word packs then load words from
			  selected word packs
				- make parser compatible with different sized word packs
